# Lifelong Summarization Design (v0.9 draft)

## Goals
- Provide a low-cost, incremental summary that guides search/query optimization.
- Keep summaries as first-class documents (new doc type), searchable like other content.
- Maintain multiple dated summary versions indefinitely for longitudinal reasoning.
- Support extensibility (new topics on the fly) with forward-only defaults.

## Facets (simplified set)
1. **User Profile**: interests + objectives (long/short-term) in a unified facet.
2. **Topics**: general abstraction for thematic groupings/projects, extensible at runtime.
3. **Timeline**: meta-facet derived from changes in profile and topic evolution.

## Representation
- **Hybrid format** per summary document:
  - **JSON** payload for tools + LLM API usage.
  - **Human-readable Markdown** for user-facing views.
- **Default language**: Chinese, with concise phrasing and character-efficient formatting.
- Include **references** in the JSON payload to support search, using chunk IDs as the
  preferred reference unit.

## Summary cadence and triggers
- **Weekly fixed schedule** as the default cadence.
- **Manual trigger** supported:
  - On manual trigger, compute activity since the last summary and only summarize
    if new material exists.

## Versioning & retention
- Store **dated summary versions** as full documents.
- **Retention**: keep all versions forever.
- Weekly summaries should focus on **events within the week**, referencing prior
  summaries only when needed for context.

## Timeline behavior
- Timeline is a **second-order summary** derived from other facets.
- Any facet that evolves over time is eligible to contribute to the timeline.
- Start with a **global timeline**; per-topic timelines are deferred.

## Topic lifecycle (initial policy)
- Topics are **created on demand** and summarize **forward only** by default.
- Retrospective summaries require explicit user request plus search.
- Forgetting/sunsetting is out of scope for v0.9 (to be designed later).

## Authority & conflict handling
- **Raw history is authoritative** when conflicts occur.

## Deferred topics
- Forgetting mechanics and retrieval-use details.
- Privacy/retention policies (e.g., tokenization of sensitive data).
- Cost vs. quality trade-offs beyond the initial baseline.

## Open questions
- Should topics allow **subtopics** or remain flat in v0.9?
- Should weekly summaries be full snapshots or minimal deltas (beyond scope for now)?
- What is the minimal “event” definition for timeline entries?
